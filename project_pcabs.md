## PCA vs B-splines in a fashion data set

**Project description:** I've been recently learning about regularization methods paired with dimensionality reduction algorithms like PCA and B-splines and when 
I found this collection of images intended as a substitute to the MNIST handwritten digits used extensively in the Data Science community, I knew I wanted to try to apply these algorithms to classify them.
The Fashion-MNIST is a dataset of Zalando's article images. Each example is a 28 x 28 grayscale image, associated with a label of 10 classes. Learn more about this dataset from Kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/zalando-research/fashionmnist?select=fashion-mnist_train.csv).

### 1. Suggest hypotheses about the causes of observed phenomena
I wanted to try them on the Fashion-MNIST dataset.I used B-splines with 10 knots to reduce dimensionality and then applied LASSO regularization. Similarly, I applied Principal Component Analysis and kept the 12th largest eigenvectors to do a LASSO regularization with them.The following plots show the regularization for the reduced coefficients on each algorithm and for the first response value.

### 2. Assess assumptions on which statistical inference will be based

```javascript
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```

### 3. Support the selection of appropriate statistical tools and techniques

### 4. Provide a basis for further data collection through surveys or experiments
