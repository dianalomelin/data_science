## PCA vs B-splines dimension reductin in a fashion data set

**Project description:** I've been recently learning about regularization methods paired with dimensionality reduction algorithms like PCA and B-splines and when 
I found this collection of images intended as a substitute to the MNIST handwritten digits used extensively in the Data Science community, I knew I wanted to try to apply these algorithms to classify them comparatively.
The Fashion-MNIST is a dataset of Zalando's article images. Each example is a 28 x 28 grayscale image, associated with a label of 10 classes. Learn more about this dataset from Kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/zalando-research/fashionmnist?select=fashion-mnist_train.csv).

### 1. Dimensionality Reduction.
When presented with a data set that has many dimensions it becomes difficult to process it and in general terms, the relevant information is contained in fewer dimensions that  can be extracted to conduct the analysis. One common approach to dimensionality reduction is Principal Component Analysis (PCA), which 


LASSO shrinks large coefficients and truncates small coefficients to zero.
I used B-splines with 10 knots to reduce dimensionality and then applied LASSO regularization. Similarly, I applied Principal Component Analysis and kept the 12th largest eigenvectors to do a LASSO regularization with them.The following plots show the regularization for the reduced coefficients on each algorithm and for the first response value. 


```javascript
if (isAwesome){
  return true

### 2. Assess assumptions on which statistical inference will be based

```javascript
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```

### 3. Support the selection of appropriate statistical tools and techniques

### 4. Provide a basis for further data collection through surveys or experiments
